# Use a for statement to print 10 random numbers.


# Repeat the above exercise but this time print 10 random numbers between 25 and 35, inclusive.


# The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is related to the lengths 
# of the other two sides. Look through the math module and see if you can find a function that will compute this 
# relationship for you. Once you find it, write a short program to try it out.




# Search on the internet for a way to calculate an approximation for pi. There are many that use simple arithmetic. 
# Write a program to compute the approximation and then print that value as well as the value of math.pi from the 
# math module.
